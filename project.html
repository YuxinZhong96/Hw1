    <div class="chapter">REFLECTION</div>

    <div id="text"><p>Try to be a user rather than merely a designer, which impressed me most during the whole design process of ebay university. As a designer, we need to test our prototypes among our targeted users again and again to make sure everything is perfect.</p></div>

    <div id="text"><p>Try to ask why again and again, and keep getting inspiration from those questions. Whatever we are building, we are constantly making chpices in the request for the better solution. To find out the real reason why a problem happened instead of only treating the symptom.</p></div>
